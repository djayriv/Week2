//Challenge #2 - Make a var called myNumber
//Set it to 0.
//Use shorthand to add 10 to it.
//Then use shorthand to subtract 1.
//Use shorthand to multiple by 9.
//Use shorthand to divide by 7.
//Just for practice, print myNumber to the console between each operation.

//example of short hand code:
//myNumber += 10;
//myNumber -= 10;
//myNumber *= 10; etc.

//Challenge #3 - Lifetime Supply
// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable.
// Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".
